            <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
            <p>Hunter Realm is a play-to-airdrop Web3 MMORPG built on the principles of player agency and community-driven growth. Players forge their own destinies across six diverse kingdoms, engaging in quests, bounties, and dynamic portal events managed via a familiar Discord interface. The game features a unique "choose-your-path" system where character stats and class evolve based on player actions. NFTs, including Heroes, Weapons, Armor, Mounts, and rare Portal Artefacts, are earned through gameplay via a free-mint airdrop system, granting tangible utility and ownership. Hunter Realm's tokenomics are deeply integrated with the vibrant tama.meme ecosystem, dedicating 90% of the total token supply to fuel community engagement, viral marketing, and liquidity initiatives. An additional 8% rewards player activity through the play-to-airdrop system, while 2% is allocated to a DAO-controlled treasury for strategic growth and stability. This whitepaper details the vision, mechanics, tokenomics, and roadmap for Hunter Realm, outlining its path to becoming a leading community-owned Web3 gaming experience.</p>

            <h2>Vision & Core Concepts</h2>
            <p>Hunter Realm is founded on the vision of "Freedom to forge destiny." We empower players to define their own journey within a rich, evolving world. The narrative unfolds across six distinct kingdoms, each with its unique lore, challenges, and opportunities, all connected through a central, mysterious Portal. Character progression is dynamic; stats and potential class archetypes evolve based on the player's choices, actions, and accomplishments, moving beyond rigid, predefined paths.</p>

        <section id="gameplay-mechanics">
            <h2>Gameplay Mechanics</h2>
            <p>The core gameplay loop is accessible directly through Discord. Players initiate their adventure using the `/begin` command and interact with the game world through quests, bounties, and spontaneous portal events. An AI Dungeon-Master enhances the experience by providing dynamic narrative elements and adapting challenges. Hunter Realm supports both active and idle gameplay; players can engage deeply in quests or benefit from passive resource generation and progression, catering to various playstyles.</p>
